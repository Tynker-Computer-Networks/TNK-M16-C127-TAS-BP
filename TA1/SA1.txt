Run following commands for Activity1 : Create executable virus file

(windows)
1. pip install pyinstaller
    ### To install python library to create executable file

2. pyinstaller --onefile filename  i.e windows.py
    # Navigate to the folder in which we created our python file.
    # Once inside the folder, let’s run the above command to create the exe file


#You can find the executable in a directory named “dist” created in the same folder as the python file.


(MAC / Linux)

# In mac or linux save the file as mac.command
#Next, we will open our terminal, navigate to the directory in which this file is saved, and then run the following command -

#### chmod +x mac.command

If the command doesn’t work, write “sudo” before the command.

Now it’s ready. If we now double click on our file, it will create the .txt file.
